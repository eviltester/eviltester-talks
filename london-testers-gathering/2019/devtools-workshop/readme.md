Back in June 2019

Viv Richards and Alan Richardson presented a workshop on Dev Tools.

This folder contains the slides and the prep notes.

We thought about tidying up the prep notes but they give a good insight into the preparation process for the workshop and we used these as our hints and tips during the workshop.
