## Overview

One of the biggest concepts that has made a difference to my programming and automating is the concept of "Tactical Vs Strategic". Tactical being for a specific purpose, possibly a bit rough around the edges, not necessarily completely robust for everyone, etc.. And Strategic being critical to long term aims, maintained and maintainable, etc. In this talk I will provide examples of both strategic and tactical automating for activities as diverse as supporting testing, marketing and general life. We will also consider how and when to move from automating tactically to strategically. And how the concept has helped me change my programming style and how I write code.

I was talking about a 'distinction' that I use to help me evaluate my processes.

Is it 'tactical'? In which case I have more flexibility in how I pursue it, with fewer expectations of long term maintenance.

Or is it 'strategic'? In which case there are more expectations about standards and approach, and more expectations around making time to 'do it'.

I discuss this distinction in the talk in relation to Automating, and in terms of process and context like Agile.
