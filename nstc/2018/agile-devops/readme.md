## Overview

If you work in Test Management at any senior level, and you read the Agile literature, then you might think that you’ll soon be out of a job. That need not be the case.

The skills that you have built up over the years can still be applied. The experience you’ve gained can still provide guidance. By revisiting the core of both Testing and Test Management we’ll understand how our lessons learned are relevant in Agile and DevOps.

This pragmatic and case study based presentation will provide the Do’s and Don'ts to help you survive, and potentially thrive, in Modern Software Development projects.

Key points:

- Agile and DevOps don’t change the core of Testing
- Understanding how our Test Processes evolved, helps us tailor them for the future
- You are not your role
