# Synopsis

We are not born testers. We become testers. Some of us become testers by circumstance, we "just stumble into it". Some of us choose the path of a tester. In both instances we then make choices to determine if, and when, we improve as testers. Everything we do in the name of 'testing' shapes us as a tester. By our every day actions we create ourselves as testers. And its important that we recognize this because we have to take responsibility for our own test approaches. Similarly we have to take responsibility for making ourselves better testers.

# In this talk

Alan will describe the dark times before he recognized his own responsibility...

- when he allowed circumstance to control his testing path, 
- and the steps he has taken to improve his testing skills
-  and make his own testing path,

... in the hope that you will be able to add some of those techniques to your own self improvement regime.

Some of us become testers by circumstance, we "just stumble into it". Some of us choose the path of a tester.

If only Alice had grabbed some of those books on the way down, perhaps they could have informed her 'fall'.

# "...and so took Alice off to see a psycho-analyst."

<!-- photo of psycho-analysis books -->

- I study Psychotherapy as a hobby
- Because I am interested in 'beliefs', how they are formed and changed
- I did not do it to improve my testing
- But it did improve my testing

---

# There are many paths

I'm not a:

- puzzle / riddle / card game person

I'm a software person and an action gamer.

**That works better for me.**

So I 'hack' JavaScript games for fun.

# Testing is a normal world activity

![original 400%](images/tote.png)

- TOTE
- George Miller

<!-- And that is the key to improving -->

<!--

Testing is Building and Comparing Models of a System to the System

Models are key

Going through customs

Model of what should be in bags
X-rays to Observe and compare against model
Interrogation down separate channel to check explore observations and model mismatch in more detail

Testing is a normal world activity

Coin purse - too bunched up , hide things behind
Stopped, asked why? expanded model, change strategy


-->


---

# Assimilate all your normal world activity and interests as 'testing'

## Not as metaphor, or simile, but as actual Testing Strategies and Processes


---

# Applied Psychotherapy

- Not a Metaphor
- Not a Simile
- I **assimilated** techniques and concepts into my Testing as Testing Techniques and concepts
 
---

# Here are some things I learned from Studying Psychotherapies that I apply directly to testing

---

# Work with the patient you have. Not the patient you want

- Every System is unique
- Avoid assumptions about how it works
- Observe below the covers to find out 'how' it actually works

---

# Therapist builds a Model the Patient's communication then asks questions to check their model, challenge patient's model and effect change

- Interactions with the system are questions
- Need to know what purpose my questioning serves
- Can be accidental change when I ask a question - am I observing deep enough?

---

# Patient tells you where the problem is if you observe and listen effectively, they also offer the solution

- Observing 'all' the details in 'all' the places is hard, need tool support
- Need to replay back 'records' of testing to spot things I missed and identify new models and questions

---

# We communicate in abstractions - generalisations, deletions, equivalence

- Apply to 'story'/'requirements'/'examples' analysis
- Specific questions: How do you know? According to whom? Specifically? Could that also mean...?

---

# Multiple Models, which can contradict, held simultaneously

- Model system from multiple angles
- Do physical models contradict logical models?
- Are models enforced at all system layers?
- Are models consistently enforced at all system layers?

---

# ... and the list goes on

- Effect of environment on behaviour and communication
- Presupposition in statements
- Intervention, Change and Manipulation

---

# I generalised my model to:

## Model
## Observe
## Reflect
## Interrogate
## Manipulate

---

# Therapies for Software Testing

- Hypnosis - Milton Erickson, NLP
- Provocative Therapy - Frank Farrelly
- Family Therapy - Virginia Satir
- Gestalt Therapy - Fritz Perls
- Brief Therapy - Steve de Shazer
- Choice Therapy - William Glasser
- Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy - Albert Ellis

---

# There are many paths

## "Don't try to imitate my voice, or my cadence. Just discover your own. Develop your own techniques. Be your own natural self. I tried to do it the way somebody else did and it was a MESS."

_Milton H. Erickson, M.D. quoted in "Taproots", 1987, O'Hanlon_

---

# Roots and Overlaps

- Family Therapy used concepts from Systems Theory
- Rational Emotive Behavioural Therapy built on General Semantics and Cybernetics
- Brief Therapies built on Mathematics - Set Theory, Discrete Mathematics (preconditions, postconditions, transformations), Theorem Proving

## Study what those you study studied

---

# Everything is As Related as _You_ Make It

## (or "Lessons Learned from studying Conspiracy Theories")

# Practical Steps to Create Yourself As a Tester

- What do you do?
- Who does it better?
- What do you think?
- Practice

---

# What do you do?

- Make notes
- Reflect
   - Do you do it well? 
   - What do you need to improve?
   - What will you do to improve?
- Act
   - Dedicate time to improving  

---

# What did I do?

- daily logs
- detailed logs when testing
- create a list of technologies I did not understand
- work through the list
- find tools to support

---

# Who does it better?

- Pick people to model.
- Observe what they do,
- Build your own model of what they do,
- try it out.
 
If you get the chance, interrogate them about their model to learn how to model them better

---

# What did I do?

Model:

- read blogs, articles, watch talks
- make my own unified notes
- apply to my situation 

Ask:

- How did they get there?
- What did they read / do?


---

# What do YOU think?

- Describe your models of testing, using your words
    - What IS Testing?
    - Why did you test that?
    - Why did you test that that way?
- Describe other people's models of testing, using your words
    - What is Agile Testing? Exploratory Testing? Automation?    

---

# What did I do?

- blog
- describe rather than define
- avoid using certain words
- share - grow up in public

New: 

- instagram - daily summary of concepts and thoughts

---

# My current testing path

- EVERYTHING is Testing
- Concentrate on applied practicalities
- Create own models and descriptions
- Practice

---

# Make your own testing path

- Keep up to date with 'testing'
    - Build your own views
- Build your own model(s) of testing, refine it over time
- Choose the language you use to describe testing
- Practice applied and practical skills

---

# You are your responsibility

## Create Yourself as a Tester
## Make Your Own Testing Path

### We never finish

<!--

Topics are as related as we make them. The more similarities we find, and the more cross-disciplinary we become in our understanding of the world, the more time we spend on improvement and the better we get.

- As I play computer games, I explore for bugs and find ways to exploit them
- My system exploration helps me identify patterns in game design and maps to find secrets more easily
- When I surf the web, I use dev tools to learn more about web development technologies
- I model my guitar playing and then find ways to traverse paths I haven't covered and expand my repertoire into new riffs and styles

The more we relate our activities, the more we can learn and improve, just by being interested in more stuff.
